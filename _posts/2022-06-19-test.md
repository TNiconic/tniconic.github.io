# Home Lab Principles

I thought it would be fitting for my first post to be about the homelab that I designed, created and built. There are a lot of homelab guides on the internet, but I noticed that none of them seem to have a focus of learning cybersecurity principles. With that in mind, my homelab is designed to serve 3 main functions.
1. Create a sandbox environment airgapped and isolated from the rest of my network.
2. Have the ability to send exploits to a target of my choosing imitating real-world scenarios.
3. See how those exploits look in a SIEM to develop future analytics. 

**TLDR:** There will also be a PDF linked below for more detailed instructions on how exactly I set everything up if you're looking for a more comprehensive guide.

# Hardare In Mind
For my homelab I bought a Ryzen 9 3900X 12 Core CPU, installed 64GB of RAM and have dual 14TB platters running in a tower like case. My personal recomendation is to have at least 12 availables cores and 32GB of RAM; why? I feels it's necessary to implement the 3rd core function into this homelab; which is a SIEM. My SIEM of choice is SecurityOnion2 which is known to be resource intesive. Even though you can still send exploits, with a SIEM you wouldn't be able to understand or see what the exploits look like from your defensive view.

# Getting Started
I'll be using Proxmox as my primary Type 1 hypervisor. Why Proxmox? It's a free and intuitive hypervisor that I didn't have much experience using. Once you have flashed the OS and begin installation, make sure you take note of the IP address your assiging your server, this will be the IP address you use to access it and you should manually give it an IP address in your home network (like 192.168.x.200). Once you have completed the installation, it's always best practice to make sure your Proxmox installation is up-to-date. 
1. You will want to update the list of websites your Proxmox repo can pull from. Edit your /etc/apt/sources.list directory and add a line named not for production use. It should look similar to the image below.

2. Next you will want to edit the enterprise list in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list and comment out the enterprise features.

 3. Lastly you will want to update your system to do that type the following commands:

 ```bash
 apt-get update
```
```bash
apt-get upgrade -y
```
There you go! You know have a working Proxmox server!
# Configuring The Networking
This is where the guide starts the get tricky. Again, if you have any problems read the detailed PDF below for more step-by-step instructions. The first thing you will want to do is login to your Proxmox server from the web (don't forget to use port :8006). Then you will want to go to the network tab of your main node. From here you should see 2 interfaces but we want to create a third and fourth. This will allow us to mirror traffic and have a sandbox environment totally isolated from the rest of our network. Create 2 bridges.
1. The first bridge is an OVS bridge, this will be our "customer network". I gave mine an IP address schema of 192.168.3.0/24. We use an OVS bridge here because we will want to mirror just this traffic and send it to our SIEM when we configure that later.
2. The next bridge will be a Linux bridge. This network will be our "red team" space. I gave mine an IP schema of 192.168.2.0/24.

Once you have those configured you're now ready to begin installing and configuring your VMs. For reference, here is a network map of the setup that we're going to be trying to create.

# Virtual Machines
In this deployment we will be utilizing mutliple Virtual Machines. These should be relatively straightforward to setup and configure. If you've never configured VM's in Proxmox before use my guide as a reference (and don't forget to import them into your Proxmox server!). I will be listing each VM and it's usecase below. The last section of this blog post will detail how to configure SecurityOnion2 after we have finished.
- PFSense
    - This will be acting as your edge router into your customers network. When configuring PFSense you will want to configure "red team" space as the WAN and "customer" space as the LAN.

    **TIP:** :You won't be able to access the PFSense WebGUI from the WAN side.
- Windows
    - Setting up Windows is a fairly straightforward process. The only change I would recommend is if you have more processing power than I do to instead configure a domain environment with an AD and at least 2 hosts connected. 
- Metasploitable
    - Metasploitable can be tricky because Proxmox doesn't natively support vmdk images. You will need to push the vmdk metasploitable image to your Proxmox via either putty/ssh and then use the built in qcow converter to make the image readable.   
- Kali
    - A fairly straightforward installation. In a future post I will show how to import other more advanced penetration testing tools.
- SecurityOnion2
    - I configured this SecurityOnion2 instance to be standalone as that's all the resources I have to spare. Additionally after I create and configure the deployment I configure a username and host firewall that way I can access it from my home network. This is the only VM that will have 2 virtual NICs (1 attached to my actual network, 1 attached to the customer network). There is no risk of spillage as we will only be using a sniffing interface which will be a mirror copy anyways.

# That's It!
Once you have all the VM's setup and running you should be able to start playing around in your sandbox. I know this guide didn't go too much into specifics on how to actually setup everything but that is the puprose of the Guide listed below.
