## About ME
I'm an experienced Cyber Engineer working for the US Government. Part of my responsibilities and skills include VM management, security policy compliance, threat hunting, data ingestion and formatting, threat actor analytic development and more. 

## Purpose of this Blog
I'm writing this blog in order to better aggregate some of the products, trainings and code that I write. I frequently get asked for various guides and trainings that I create and I hope that this website serves as a platform to help out others. Lastly, I'm hoping to hear from individuals like yourself on how I can improve and do some things better. Please if you have any comments or suggestion feel free to reach out either via my email or one of the social medias I'll have linked below.
