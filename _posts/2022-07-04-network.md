# Cyber Range PT II
Welcome back! In part 2 of this blog post we will be configuring the networking, joining our servers to our domain, and begin capturing network traffic off our SecurityOnion2 SIEM that we will also be configuring. Let's get started!

# Networking

I understand networking is something that can be pretty daunting for some people. It's the reason why I try to 
express my thoughts and frame them in understandable terms. In short there may be better ways of doing what I'm doing, but I found this works for me and is relatively easy to understand! For this networking configuration we need to really only complete 3 goals. 
        
        1. We need to ensure that the Windows Server VM in our WECNet can talk with our Domain Controller in the CyberRange net so that it can join the domain.
        2. We need to make sure the RedTeam has a way into our network to better emulate real-world scenarios. 
        3. We want this environment to be air-gapped from the real-world that way we have a true sandbox environment.
